```

### Performance
- **Test Accuracy**: 72.48% ± 0.76% (mean ± std over 5 seeds)
- **Validation Accuracy**: 72.69% ± 0.91%
- **95% CI for Test**: [71.81%, 73.15%]
- **Coefficient of Variation**: 1.05% (highly stable)

## Optimization Journey

### 1. Initial Baseline
- Simple architecture: ~65% accuracy
- No systematic optimization

### 2. Architecture Search
- Tested various depths and widths
- Found 5-layer deep narrow optimal: [384,256,128,64,32]
- Improvement: 65% → 70%

### 3. Hyperparameter Optimization
- **Learning Rate**: 0.001 → 0.003 (3x increase)
- **Dropout**: 0.15 → 0.1 (reduced)
- **Weight Decay**: 0.001 → 0.0 (removed)
- Improvement: 70% → 72.5%

### 4. Activation Function Search
- Tested 19 different activations
- ReLU outperformed all others
- Improvement: marginal (~0.5%)

### 5. Early Stopping Implementation
- Proper train/val/test splits (80/10/10)
- Prevents overfitting
- Consistent ~72% on held-out test set

### 6. GLU Architecture Test
- Implemented Gated Linear Units
- Result: Underperformed at 65%
- Conclusion: Standard linear layers better for this task

### 7. Stability Analysis
- Tested across 5 random seeds
- CV of 1.05% - excellent stability
- True performance: 72.5% ± 0.8%

### 8. CLIP Model Variants (In Progress)
- Current: ViT-B/32 (512D embeddings)
- Testing: ViT-B/16, ViT-L/14
- Expected improvement: +1-3%

## Key Insights

1. **Simplicity Wins**: ReLU > complex activations, Linear > GLU
2. **Deep Narrow Better**: [384,256,128,64,32] optimal architecture
3. **Higher LR Possible**: 3x increase (0.003) improves performance
4. **Less Regularization**: Removing weight decay helps
5. **Model is Stable**: <2% variation across seeds

## Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations
- Performance plateau around 72-73%
- Limited by CLIP embedding quality
- Inter-labeler disagreement ceiling

### Potential Improvements
1. **Better CLIP Models**: ViT-L/14 could add 2-3%
2. **Ensemble Methods**: Multiple models could reach 74-75%
3. **Feature Engineering**: Additional features beyond CLIP
4. **Semi-Supervised Learning**: Leverage unlabeled data

## Reproducibility

### To Reproduce Best Results
```bash
python train_with_early_stopping.py --config-name=unified_optimal_final
```

### Expected Performance
- Single run: 71-73% test accuracy
- 5-run average: 72.5% ± 0.8%

## Conclusion

We achieved a robust **72.5% test accuracy** through systematic optimization:
- Started at ~65%
- Optimized to 72.5% (7.5% absolute improvement)
- Model is highly stable (CV < 2%)
- Near theoretical ceiling given labeler disagreement

The model is production-ready with predictable, reproducible performance.
