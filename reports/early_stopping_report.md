# Early Stopping Results Report

## Configuration
- **Data Split**: 80% train, 10% validation, 10% test
- **Early Stopping**: Patience=10 epochs, min_delta=0.001
- **Best Model**: Stopped at epoch 44, best model from epoch 34
- **Architecture**: 5-layer deep narrow [384, 256, 128, 64, 32]
- **Hyperparameters**: LR=0.001, dropout=0.15, weight_decay=0.001, GELU, BatchNorm

## Results Summary

### Validation Set (10% of data)
- **Average Accuracy**: 72.64%
- **Average CE Loss**: 0.5206
- Attractive: 75.26% accuracy
- Smart: 70.82% accuracy
- Trustworthy: 71.82% accuracy

### Test Set (10% held-out data)
- **Average Accuracy**: 72.02%
- **Average CE Loss**: 0.5382
- Attractive: 71.74% accuracy
- Smart: 71.12% accuracy
- Trustworthy: 73.22% accuracy

## Key Findings

1. **Generalization**: Only 0.62% drop from validation (72.64%) to test (72.02%), indicating good generalization
2. **Early Stopping Effectiveness**: Training stopped at epoch 44, preventing overfitting
3. **Consistent Performance**: Test accuracy matches our previous best results (~72%)
4. **No Overfitting**: Test loss (0.5382) close to validation loss (0.5206)

## Comparison with Previous Results

| Method | Validation | Test | Notes |
|--------|------------|------|-------|
| Original (no early stop) | 72.5% | N/A | 20% validation only |
| With Early Stopping | 72.64% | 72.02% | Proper 10/10 split |
| GLU Architecture | 65.3% | N/A | Underperformed |

## Conclusion

Early stopping successfully prevents overfitting while maintaining high performance. The model generalizes well to unseen test data with minimal performance degradation (0.62%). The 72% accuracy appears to be a robust upper bound for this task with the current architecture and CLIP embeddings.
