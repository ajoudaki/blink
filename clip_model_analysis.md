# CLIP Model Analysis Report

## Current Setup
- **Model**: ViT-B/32 (Vision Transformer Base with 32x32 patches)
- **Embedding Dimension**: 512
- **Performance Achieved**: 72.48% ± 0.76% test accuracy

## CLIP Model Variants Analysis

### Available CLIP Models (by increasing power)

| Model | Embedding Dim | Parameters | Resolution | Expected Improvement |
|-------|--------------|------------|------------|---------------------|
| **ViT-B/32** (current) | 512 | 86M | 224x224 | Baseline |
| ViT-B/16 | 512 | 86M | 224x224 | +1-2% (finer patches) |
| ViT-L/14 | 768 | 304M | 224x224 | +2-4% (larger model) |
| ViT-L/14@336px | 768 | 304M | 336x336 | +3-5% (higher resolution) |

### Why Different CLIP Models Could Help

1. **ViT-B/16** (Vision Transformer Base/16)
   - Uses 16x16 patches instead of 32x32
   - Better fine-grained feature extraction
   - Same embedding dimension (512) - easy drop-in replacement
   - Expected: ~1-2% improvement

2. **ViT-L/14** (Vision Transformer Large/14)
   - 3.5x more parameters (304M vs 86M)
   - Larger embedding dimension (768 vs 512)
   - Better semantic understanding
   - Expected: ~2-4% improvement

3. **ViT-L/14@336px** (Highest Resolution)
   - Same as ViT-L/14 but trained on 336x336 images
   - Best for detailed facial features
   - Highest computational cost
   - Expected: ~3-5% improvement

## Implementation Considerations

### Required Changes for Different Models

1. **Embedding Dimension Update**:
   ```python
   # Current (ViT-B/32)
   input_dim = 512

   # For ViT-L models
   input_dim = 768
   ```

2. **Memory Requirements**:
   - ViT-B/32: ~350MB
   - ViT-B/16: ~350MB
   - ViT-L/14: ~900MB
   - ViT-L/14@336px: ~900MB

3. **Extraction Time**:
   - ViT-B models: ~1ms per image
   - ViT-L models: ~3ms per image
   - Higher resolution: ~5ms per image

## Recommendations

### For Maximum Performance
Use **ViT-L/14@336px**:
- Highest expected accuracy (~75-77%)
- Best for facial feature extraction
- Worth the computational cost for final deployment

### For Quick Improvement
Use **ViT-B/16**:
- Easy drop-in replacement (same embedding size)
- Minimal code changes required
- Expected ~73-74% accuracy

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

| Model | Expected Accuracy | Extraction Time | Storage | Recommendation |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|---------|----------------|
| ViT-B/32 (current) | 72.5% | 1x | 512D | Baseline |
| ViT-B/16 | 73.5% | 1x | 512D | Easy upgrade |
| ViT-L/14 | 74.5% | 3x | 768D | Best balance |
| ViT-L/14@336px | 75.5% | 5x | 768D | Maximum performance |

## Implementation Status

Due to image access limitations, we cannot directly test different CLIP models. However, based on CLIP benchmarks:

1. **ViT-L/14** typically outperforms ViT-B/32 by 3-5% on visual tasks
2. Face recognition tasks benefit from higher resolution (336px)
3. The embedding dimension increase (512→768) provides richer representations

## Next Steps

To implement CLIP model switching:

1. **Modify train.py** to accept CLIP model as parameter:
   ```python
   model, preprocess = clip.load(cfg.clip_model, device=device)
   ```

2. **Update model architecture** to handle different embedding dimensions:
   ```python
   input_dim = CLIP_DIMENSIONS[cfg.clip_model]
   ```

3. **Re-extract embeddings** with new model (one-time cost)

4. **Fine-tune hyperparameters** for new embedding space

## Conclusion

While we achieved **72.5%** with ViT-B/32, switching to **ViT-L/14** could potentially reach **75-76%** accuracy. The main trade-off is computational cost during embedding extraction (one-time) and slightly larger model size.

The improvement would come from:
- Better semantic understanding (larger model)
- Richer feature representations (768D vs 512D)
- Improved face detail capture (with @336px variant)
