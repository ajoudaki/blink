## Task Comparison

| Task | Accuracy | Task Type | Performance |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Comparison** | 72.5% | Binary classification | Excellent |
| **Rating** | 57.3% | 4-way classification | Good |

### Key Observations

1. **Rating is harder than comparison**:
   - 4-way classification (25% random baseline) vs binary (50% random baseline)
   - Achieved 57.3% accuracy, which is 2.3× better than random

2. **Low MAE (0.468)**:
   - On average, predictions are off by less than 0.5 rating points
   - Most errors are likely adjacent ratings (e.g., predicting 3 when true is 2)

3. **Consistent performance across targets**:
   - Smart performs slightly better (59.0%)
   - Attractive and Trustworthy similar (~57%)

4. **Stable training**:
   - Low standard deviation (±0.5%) across runs
   - Architecture generalizes well to rating task

## Metrics Interpretation

- **Accuracy (57.3%)**: Correct exact rating prediction rate
- **MAE (0.468)**: Average distance from true rating (scale 0-3)
- **RMSE (0.744)**: Root mean squared error, penalizes large errors more
- **CE Loss (1.161)**: Cross-entropy loss for 4-way classification

## Conclusion

✅ The optimized architecture successfully transfers to the rating task:
- **57.3% accuracy** on 4-way classification (significantly above 25% random baseline)
- **Low MAE (0.468)** indicates predictions are typically very close to true ratings
- **Consistent performance** across multiple runs and targets
- The deep narrow architecture proves effective for both comparison and rating tasks
